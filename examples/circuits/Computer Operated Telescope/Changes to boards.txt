Changes to Boards

1. Changed board size formost boards due to the fact that my local supplier (Maplin) doesn't do boards any bigger than 39 strips.

2. Added LEDPlate as per Rafael Gonzalez Website.

3. Added 2 pin connectors to ciruit diagrams and boards for both the Altitude and Azimuth Circuits to connect LED Plate. Notice that I have not included a limit resistor as Rafael has done. This is because the LEDs from Maplin (part no. CJ36T) have built in limit resistors for running of 12v.

4. Changed Bridge Rectifier on Dual PSU 1

5. Changed DC-DC Converter on Dual PSU 1, back to original design. (dont know why, but still.)

6. Added a complete parts list for all the boards with Part numbers and prices. (UK)
