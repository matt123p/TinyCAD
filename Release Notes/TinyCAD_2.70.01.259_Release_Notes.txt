Changes from TinyCAD 2.70.00.248 Beta Release:

Added .TCLib (SQLite3) format libraries to the installer.
Added XML format netlist capability
Fixed problem in .TCLib library editor that caused updates to the library 
	to not always refresh in the schematic editor without closing and 
	then reopening the schematic file.  Thanks Mark Langezaal!
Added improved pin name and number auto-increment capability to provide 
	better support for alpha-numeric pin names and numbers.  
	Thanks Thomas Peterson!
Added improved reference designator assignment so that designators are 
	labeled according to the order of their XY coordinates.  When 
	auto-assigning reference designators, designators are now assigned
	to the sorted XY coordinates so that symbols located to the upper 
	left of the schematic are assigned lower numbers than symbols located
	to the lower right of the schematic.  Thanks Oleg Skydan!
