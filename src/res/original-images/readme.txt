This folder contains original images used to generate the images
in the res folder.

The png images are put together in the Adobe Illustrator files and
from Illustrator exported to bmp images in the parent (res) folder.

The height of the tool bar images is 16 px. The 2.60.xx releas has
15x15 px images. Don't know why but it seems to be better results with
16 px height.

Every original image from VS 2008 is in png format and they are 
made 1 px smaller on the width. Otherwise TinyCAD can't separate
the images when making the tool bar. Original images used are 
16x16 px.
